# No Nonsense ATR
## Overview

No Nonsense ATR is a tool designed to help the [NNFX Traders](https://nononsenseforex.com/) backtest strategies and trading in real time. **Last Version - 5.80**

The indicator calculates the value of the SL/TP based on the [ATR](https://nononsenseforex.com/indicators/the-worlds-best-forex-indicator/) allowing to verify the historical data in a simple and practical way, showing not only the SL/TP values but also the place where they would be and if it was a gain or loss. 
The No Nonsense ATR also calculates the trading volume required for each trade according to the desired risk, using the SL and the account currency for the calculation thus giving a more accurate value.
